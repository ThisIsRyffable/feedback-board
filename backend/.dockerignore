db.sqlite3  # Optional: if you want the image to always start with a fresh DB.
            # For dev, usually mounted from host, so this line might be commented out or removed
            # if you want the local db.sqlite3 to be copied as a starting point if no volume is mounted.
            # Given the volume mount `./backend:/app`, the host's db.sqlite3 will be used anyway.
            # Adding it here ensures COPY . . doesn't bring a host db.sqlite3 into the image layers.
